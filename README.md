Here is my compilation of projects made with Love2d.
Love2d is very forgiving to setup and start using compared to C++ counterparts such as SFML or SDL2.

Notes: I'm using atom as an IDE. I'm using this library called save autorun which allows me to save the main file and it will automatically quit and run the game for me automatically which is cool. You can see the code for that in .save.cson

Projects:
* static noise
* yin yang
