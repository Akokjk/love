Here is a compliation of projects made with Love2d.
Love2d is very forgiving to setup and start using compared to c++ counterparts such as SFML or SDL2. I prefer compling direct with ming_w32 on windows which makes it slightly difficult because sfml isn't part of the path like when you install on it linux. I used to really good at create static executables that could hide all the necessary .dlls and work well across systems all from the joy of make but alas I was a naive coder and lost it. >:(  


Notes: I'm using atom as an IDE. I'm using this library called save autorun which allows me to save the main file and it will automatically quit and run the game for me automatically which is cool. You can see the code for that in .save.cson 

Projects:
