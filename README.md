Here is a compliation of projects made with Love2d.
Love2d is very forgiving to setup and start using compared to c++ counterparts such as SFML or SDL2. I prefer compling direct with ming_w32 on windows which makes it slightly difficult because sfml isn't part of the path like when you install on it linux. I used to really good at create static executables that could hide all the necessary .dlls and work well across systems all from the joy of make but alas I was a naive coder and lost it. >:(  


Projects:
* static noise
* yin yang
